                <h3>Possible Discussion Questions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is your relationship with politics? How has this evolved for you, if at all?
                    </li>
                    <li>How has your family/community/work/school shaped your political beliefs?
                    </li>
                    <li>What are our duty as citizens? In what ways can we be more engaged in our communities in the coming month? What have been the biggest barriers for you in getting more involved?
                    </li>
                    <li>How do we disagree respectfully with others? What are ways to engage in conversations with those who disagree with our own views? (Examples/stories help.)Could be interesting to share any stories of times you have gone through a major change in one of your political views / core beliefs: how did that happen / what did you learn? Experiences like this can help us see how we can genuinely try to understand opinions very different from our own
                    </li>
                    <li>Trump and Clinton have the highest unfavorable ratings of any candidates in the history of presidential polling in the U.S. How did we get to this place? What does it say about our electoral system that the choices we have are so unpopular? 
                    </li>
                    <li>Why is it that we've heard so much about Trump and Clinton, but so much less about any other race? Why do down ballot races receive so little attention, and how should we respond to that? 
                    </li>
                    <li>What is our vision for the common good? How do we support that vision in our roles as citizens? What steps can we take to weave our citizenship into the fabric of our regular lives so that we're living out that calling beyond the voting every two or four years? What does it look like to continue engaging in the civic sphere even as Christian influence is increasingly waning? 
                    </li>
                    <li>Fear is a major part of our public discourse. Why is that? When we as Christians participate or buy into that mentality, what are we most afraid of? How can we be intentional about rooting out fear-based thought in our own political views and biases?
                    </li>
                    <li>By some measures, partisanship is about as bad as it's ever been. For a variety of reasons and in a variety of ways, people are simply reaching out across party lines less. What does it mean to love your neighbor when your neighbor is actively campaigning for a political candidate or view that you believe is offensive or wrong or even evil? How do we maintain a civil attitude and an open heart, even when we've made up our mind that a particular candidate or policy position is the wrong direction?
                    </li>
                    <li>What are your favorite go-to resources for staying informed about and involved in political issues?
                    </li>
                </ol>
